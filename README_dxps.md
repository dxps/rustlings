## My Notes

According to [this](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/issues/443) and [this](https://gist.github.com/jackos/7332fa8ab0b67a87f382fd566696f412), in order to have the proper intellisense and code completion in VSCode, install and run `rustlings-fix` in this project location:

```shell
❯ cargo install rustlings-fix
❯ 
❯ rustlings-fix
```
